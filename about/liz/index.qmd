As the Chair of Global Health Engineering at ETH Zurich, Elizabeth is obsessed with answering some not so simple questions: Why after 70 years of dedicated interventions doesn’t everyone on earth have access to a toilet? And, how can we make sure that no one ever dies from a preventable, sanitation-related disease? She believes that some of the answers are probably hidden in data that someone has produced, but hasn’t made accessible: yet!

Her role in the FAIRqual project is of advisory nature. With her experience in managing a group that implements FAIR data principles to their work, she understands what it takes to make it priority.
