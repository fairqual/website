I am an interdisciplinary scholar working in the anthropology of science and technology while implementing transdisciplinary approaches for sustainable development. As a Group Leader of “Cultural Studies of Science and Technology”, I investigate with my team the specific conditions for inter- and transdisciplinary research and funding. Therefore, qualitative methods are at the centre of my research and teaching.

My role in the FAIRqual project is to support the team with and contribute to the research process, grounding us into the challenges and opportunities that transdisciplinary research faces.
