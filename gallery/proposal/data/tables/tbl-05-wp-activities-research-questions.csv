WP,Project Activity,Research Question
WP1,Activity 1.1: Literature review on development of questionnaire for Td and qualitative research,RQ 1.1: What procedures are currently used by researchers and practitioners to collect qualitative data in transdisciplinary settings? How do they assure FAIR principles?
WP1,Activity 1.2: Identification of tools for the collection of and transcription of data,RQ 1.2: What are best practice workflows for data management in order to share qualitative data?
WP1,Activity 1.3: Development of workflows for transformation of text files in different formats to machine-readable table format,"RQ 1.3: What kinds of possibilities exist for collecting and sharing data from transdisciplinary methods using qualitative techniques, which might include workshops using flip chart drawings, post-it notes, group conversations, marked up maps, and other mixed media?"
WP2,Activity 2.1: Ethics application explaining the unique character of our study. Possible collaboration with ETH research ethics committee to discuss,"RQ 2.1: Under what conditions does sharing of qualitative data generated during Td research provide benefits for a) research participants, b) the Td project itself, or c) the Td community?"
WP2,"Activity 2.2: Workshop at the ITD Conference 2024 to identify and systematize  diverse perspectives on the topic, refine interview protocol; potential recruitment of participants for interviews",RQ 2.2: What are the risks of sharing Td data openly to the groups listed above (RQ 2.1)? How can these be mitigated?
WP2,"Activity 2.3: Identification and recruitment of interview respondents, drawing from TdLab's extensive network. Conduct interviews (in-person or via zoom) with 15 to 20 respondents","RQ 2.3: If qualitative data is shared, what are potential formats for sharing this data to make it not only available to researchers but also to societal actors?"
WP2,Activity 2.4: Transcription and conversion of interview audio files,"RQ 2.4: What kinds of concerns or benefits are specific to particular kinds of data? In other words, how is interview data different from workshop data? How might multia-media data be shared?"
